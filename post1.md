There are a few options for buying and setting up your cell phone. The first is signing up for a cell service like AT&T or TMobile and going to one of their stores and asking for a phone. They'll give you a SIM card (thing that has your number) and you get to pick from their inventory what phone you want. Another option is taking your SIM card and getting a carrier unlocked phone.
