# I installed LineageOS on a 2019 Google Pixel 4
LineageOS is an open-source operating system derived from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). AOSP is an operating system maintained by Google, and Android is essentially AOSP with added proprietary software from Google, such as the Google Play Store and Google Chrome. LineageOS builds on the AOSP core, incorporating its own unique features. 

## Reduction in e-waste
LineageOS brings the latest version of AOSP and security updates to over 190 devices, many that no longer relieve updates from their manufacturer. Statistics show the average person upgrades their phone every 2.7 years, with some upgrading every year. According to Ecowatch, 5 billion smart phones became e-waste in 2022. This isn't too shocking since smart phones have been the standard since around 2010 and there are 7 billion people in the world. However, that's still a lot of phones taking up space in desk drawers and landfills. 

It makes sense why people choose to upgrade their smartphones when they stop receiving security updates and device support. But for those who don't mind tinkering with their phones, take extra security measures, and go the extra mile on device care, LineageOS can breath life back into an abandoned device. 

## The installation process
Installing LineageOS was surprisingly simple! I just needed my phone, my laptop, and a data cable. The LineageOS website has links to each device it supports and the files needed to install on the phone.

Warning: Part of the installation steps includes unlocking the phone's bootloader which will wipe the device's data and will void the device's warrenty. 


## Installing Google Apps
By default, LineageOS doesn't ship with Google services for licensing reasons. During the installation process, you can add the Gapps package which will enable things like the google play store, google data transfer, google photos, etc. 

I opted to not add the Gapps package. I don't need to be logged into my email on my phone since I have my laptop accessible to me almost all the time. I don't need Google Photos to move pictures between my PC and my phone since I just transfer data using a USB cable. Instead of Google authenticator I set up Aegis Authenticator. All my contacts are saved in a .vcf file on my computer that I can transfer to new devices. There are a few apps I need on my phone from the Google Play store like Charge point, but I was able to install that on my phone through the Aurora store. I moved some music files from my PC to my phone for when I'm driving or at the gym, so I don't need to install Spotify or any music streaming apps. Instead of Youtube I use NewPipe, a free open source Youtube client (which has extra perks like no ads and still runs when the app is minimized!). 

The point is, with a little extra effort there are ways to have a fully functional smart phone without Google's services. 

## My experience after a few days
My favorite thing about my new phone set up is how fast it is! This is largely because the Google Pixel 4 is already expected to be high performance with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU and 90Hz display. However, the UI feels clean and zippy with web pages loading instantly. Without Google's services running on the phone at all times it definitely takes the load off the CPU. The battery life is pretty good despite the phone's tiny 2800 mAh battery, lasting well throughout the day. Not having a headphone jack isn't ideal, but I've been using an $8 USB-c to aux adapter with no issues. 

I've been pleasantly surprised with how smooth the installation process went and having fun exploring the new terrain of a de-googled google phone (which prior would still be stuck at Android 13). Also, I got the Google Pixel 4 in it's vibrant 'oh-so orange' which I just love! I even had Midjourney generate a new phone wallpaper to match my new phone's theme. 

If you are curious about LineageOS or want to try out a de-googled phone, I recommend installing it on an older phone you have laying around, or on a new phone if its time for one.
