### Google Pixel 4 specs

The criteria I had in mind for my next phone was:
**Essentials**
* High performance CPU  
* Minimum 4gb ram  
* New, not used or refurbished  
**Non-Essentials:**  
* Storage space 
* Finger print reader/face id  

After days of research and looking at unlocked phones on Amazon, I decided to get a Google Pixel 4 because pixels are generally well supported by LineageOS. The choice came down to a Google pixel 4 vs a Google pixel 4a. The pixel 4 launched in October 2019 as the higher end choice retailing for $899 and came with Android 10. The Google Pixel 4a launched later in August 2020 as the budget friendly choice retailing for $350.
