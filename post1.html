<h1 id="iinstalledlineageosona2019googlepixel4">I installed LineageOS on a 2019 Google Pixel 4</h1>
<p>LineageOS is an open-source operating system derived from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). AOSP is an operating system maintained by Google, and Android is essentially AOSP with added proprietary software from Google, such as the Google Play Store and Google Chrome. LineageOS builds on the AOSP core, incorporating its own unique features </p>

<p>LineageOS supports over 190 devices, many that no longer recieve updates from their manufactorer. This is a huge plus because many devices still stuck on Android 12 and below have perfectly working hardware. Lineage can make new versions run on those 'outdated' devices. Many of us would rather hold on to our phones until they drop dead without worrying about running a phone that no longer gets security updates. </p>

<p>The criteria I had in mind for my next phone was:
    * Small screen size, &lt; 6 inches<br />
    * High performance CPU<br />
    * Minimum 4gb ram<br />
    * New, not used or refurbished<br />
Non-Priorities:
    * Storage space, I didn't need more than  64 gb<br />
    * Finger print reader<br />
    * Camera quality  </p>
